Problem Statement: Heart Disease Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview:
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and accurate
diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates. Traditional methods
for diagnosing heart disease often rely on clinical examinations, medical imaging, and diagnostic tests,
which can be time-consuming and expensive. With the advancement of machine learning (ML), there is an opportunity
to enhance early diagnosis and improve predictive accuracy by leveraging historical medical data.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict 
the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on their medical data, such as age, sex, 
blood pressure, cholesterol levels, ECG results, and other relevant health indicators. The model 
will be trained on a dataset containing features that are indicative of heart disease, enabling healthcare
professionals to make more informed decisions and take preventive measures.

Problem:
Given a dataset of medical attributes (such as age, sex, chest pain type, 
resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, etc.), the goal is to build a predictive model
that classifies whether a patient has heart disease (1) or does not have heart disease (0).

Data:
The dataset used for training the model consists of the following attributes:
Age
Sex
Chest pain type (4 types)
Resting blood pressure
Serum cholesterol
Fasting blood sugar (greater than 120 mg/dl)
Resting electrocardiographic results (ECG)
Maximum heart rate achieved
Exercise induced angina
ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
Thalassemia (a blood disorder)

Expected Outcome:
The machine learning model should be capable of predicting whether a patient is likely to have 
heart disease based on the given features with a high degree of accuracy. This can help medical 
professionals in early diagnosis and enable timely interventions for individuals at risk. The model 
can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its effectiveness
in real-world applications.

Challenges:
Handling missing or incomplete data.
Dealing with imbalanced classes, as heart disease cases may be fewer compared to non-heart disease cases.
Ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data and avoids overfitting.

Conclusion:
The project will demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques in the early detection of heart disease, 
facilitating timely diagnosis and better healthcare outcomes. The solution can be further extended to real-time prediction systems,
providing valuable support for medical practitioners in hospitals and clinics.
